# rubberband
An experiment on making a rubberband effect like the showcased on iOS 9's new Siri. This is having a series of concatenated ``UIScrollView``s (or collection or table views) in a way that once you reach the end of one of them, you can scroll to the next one, and the opposite (scrolling to the top).
Implemented with Swift.
